<p>I would venture I'm older than most other code camp students - I like to think of myself as a not so old dog learning new tricks.  I've been in the market research business for over 10 years now, but my passion lies in coding.  I've used python, javascript and a little CSS3 but am looking to really learn how to be a developer.</p>
