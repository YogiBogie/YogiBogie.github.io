As I stated in my bio, I've been in market reserach for over 10 years now working on surveys.  In this capactiy I've been able to learn/use programming language such as Python/Javascript/CSS.  

In truth programming is my favorite part of the job.  I love the challenge of taking a blank document and turning it into directions that describe just how I want something executed.  The problem is, in my job I don't get to program as much as I'd want to - more so it seems I do less and less of it as the time goes on.  

In all honesty the limited programming I get to do means that while I do know how to code a little, I don't have a chance to refine my skills.  That's why I joined learn, because I have a passion for programming and I would love to turn that passion into a career where I get to build something greater that what I've been able to at my current job.

I won't pretend that coding is easy, but that's ok.  I love the challenge.  Though sometimes it can be hard and can easily humble you, the breakthrough moments when you finally solve a hard problem are what drive me to want to code and learn more about coding.

In short, I Love to Code.
